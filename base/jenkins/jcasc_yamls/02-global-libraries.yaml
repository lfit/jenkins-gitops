# Global Pipeline Libraries Configuration
#
# Defines shared pipeline libraries available to all Jenkins jobs.
# Libraries provide reusable pipeline code and standardized build functions.
#
# TYPICAL LIBRARY CONFIGURATION:
# - name: Library identifier used in Jenkinsfile @Library declarations
# - retriever: Source location (Git repository, branch, credentials)
# - defaultVersion: Default branch/tag to use if not specified
# - allowDefaultVersionOverride: Allow jobs to specify different versions
# - implicit: Automatically load library without @Library declaration
#
# Libraries enable standardized CI/CD patterns across all projects.
# Configure libraries here when shared pipeline code is available.
#
# WHY THIS FILE IS MINIMAL:
# No shared libraries are currently configured.
# Add configurations here when projects provide reusable pipeline code.
