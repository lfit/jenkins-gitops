# Main Jenkins Configuration

# This file acts as the base layer for Jenkins Configuration as Code (JCasC).
# The "00-" prefix ensures it loads first, establishing core Jenkins settings.
# This ordering helps maintain clean GitOps deployments and prevents conflicts
# with other configs.
#
# Common settings (executors, systemMessage, etc.) are now managed in
# values.yaml
#
# WHY THIS FILE IS MINIMAL:
# Core settings are defined in Helm chart values instead of JCasC.
# This avoids ConfiguratorConflictException with chart defaults
# (e.g., numExecutors, executorMode, projectNamingStrategy).
